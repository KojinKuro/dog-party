## 📝 Description

This is a project created for on practicing [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to match a design comp provided. The design comp is for a fake dog website. Through doing this I gained a better understanding of the more advanced Sass features that I avoided using in the past. This project only uses HTML and Sass, with Webpack setup as the bundler.

## ⚙️ Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:KojinKuro/dog-party.git
cd dog-party
npm install
npm run start
```

Server URL: `http://localhost:8080/`

Live deployment: [`https://kojinkuro.github.io/dog-party/`](https://kojinkuro.github.io/dog-party/)

## 🌐 Context

This project was given during week 9 of a 32 week coding boot camp at Turing School of Software and Design. The project took around 3 hours to complete. It was a solo project where I was the only developer.

## 🎓 Learning Goals

The main focus of this project was about learning to use Sass to match a design comp as closely as possible. Before doing this project I had previous experience using Sass, but slowly moved away from it. Many of the features I enjoyed about Sass had already been implemented into vanilla CSS, so I found little reason to use it. Coming back into using Sass, I spent most of my time using the features that haven't been implemented (mixins and partial imports) and found that they were able to keep my files more organized. In the future I will try using Sass more to see where else they can clean up my files.
